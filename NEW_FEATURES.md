# New Features Implementation

## Changes Made (Round 2)

### 1. Actions Column Width Increased ‚úÖ
- Increased from 6% to 8% so "Edit Email" fits on one line
- Adjusted other columns to maintain proper layout

### 2. Removed "Move" Column Header ‚úÖ
- The drag handle column now has no header text
- Column remains functional for dragging

### 3. Personalization Token Cleanup ‚úÖ
- Created `cleanPersonalizationTokens()` helper function
- Automatically removes `{{ personalization_token('` and `', 'backup_value') }}` syntax
- Shows only the field name in Subject Line and Body Preview columns
- Example: `{{ personalization_token('deal.admin_association_first_name', 'Hi there') }}` ‚Üí `deal.admin_association_first_name`

### 4. Workflow Group Drag-and-Drop ‚úÖ
- Workflows can now be reordered by dragging the ‚ãÆ‚ãÆ handle on each workflow header
- Order is automatically saved and persists across sessions and users
- New workflows automatically appear at the end of the list

### 5. Workflow Notes Feature ‚úÖ
- **Add Note Button**: Green "+ Add Note" button appears on each workflow header
- **Edit Note Button**: Blue "Edit Note" button replaces the add button when a note exists
- **Note Preview**: First 50 characters of the note display with a üìù icon
- **Modal Interface**: Click the button to open a modal where you can enter/edit notes
- **Persistence**: Notes are saved automatically and visible to all users

### 6. Complete Persistence Across Users ‚úÖ
All changes are saved to the backend (`/data/workflow-settings.json`) and persist across:
- Browser sessions
- Different users
- Page refreshes
- Dashboard updates

**Persisted Data:**
- Workflow order (drag-and-drop arrangement)
- Workflow notes (custom notes for each workflow)
- Email row order within each workflow

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created:
1. **`/app/api/workflow-settings/route.ts`** - API endpoint for reading/writing settings
2. **`/data/workflow-settings.json`** - JSON file storing all user preferences

### Modified Files:
1. **`/app/page.tsx`** - Complete rewrite with new features:
   - `SortableWorkflowGroup` component for draggable workflow groups
   - `NoteModal` component for note editing
   - `cleanPersonalizationTokens()` helper function
   - State management for notes, workflow order, and email orders
   - Backend integration for persistence

### Data Structure:
```json
{
  "workflowOrder": ["Workflow A", "Workflow B", "Workflow C"],
  "workflowNotes": {
    "Workflow A": "This is a note about workflow A",
    "Workflow B": "Important: Check this weekly"
  },
  "emailOrders": {
    "Workflow A": ["email-id-1", "email-id-2", "email-id-3"],
    "Workflow B": ["email-id-4", "email-id-5"]
  }
}
```
