# Changes Made

## 1. Fixed 19 vs 300 Emails Issue
**Problem**: Only 19 unique emails were showing instead of 300+ email instances
**Solution**: Changed API to return email-workflow PAIRS instead of unique emails. Now if an email appears in 3 workflows, you get 3 rows.

## 2. Grouped by Workflow
**Feature**: Emails are now grouped by workflow name in expandable/collapsible sections
- Click workflow name to expand/collapse
- Workflow name links to HubSpot workflow (using workflow IDs from v3 API)
- Shows email count per workflow

## 3. Column Size Adjustments
- Email Name: 18% width
- Subject Line: 18% width  
- From Name: 18% width (same as Email Name and Subject)
- Body Preview: 30% width (bigger than before)
- Actions: 16% width

## 4. Body Preview Improvements
- Text is now inline (not truncated with ellipsis)
- Collapsed by default
- Click arrow button (▼) to expand full text
- Click again (▲) to collapse

## 5. Workflow IDs from v3 API
- Changed from `/automation/v4/flows` to `/automation/v3/workflows`
- Now uses correct workflow IDs for links

## API Changes
- `route.ts`: Now returns `emailWorkflowPairs` array where each entry is an email-workflow pairing
- Added fields: `workflowId`, `workflowName` to each email object
- Increased body preview to 500 characters (from 200)

## Frontend Changes
- `page.tsx`: Groups emails by workflow
- Added collapsible workflow sections
- Added collapsible body preview with expand/collapse button
- Adjusted column widths as requested
- All workflows expanded by default
